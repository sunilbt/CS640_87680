	<p>Internet Web Security(IWS) class introduced me to basics of routers,switches and firewall. This course provided fundamentals of computer security as the first step towards learning how to protect computers from hackers. We got to  know the very basic concepts of computer security and substantial technical details to be involved. It also provided a hands-on lab on configuring routers. This course included a few security games which made learning more exciting and interactive. We also got a clear vision on how all seven layers will work in IOS model and different levels of security in each layer.</p>
